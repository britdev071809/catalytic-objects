# The Chronological Catalyst Project

Welcome to the **Chronological Catalyst Project**—a collaborative digital archive dedicated to documenting "Catalytic Objects": artefacts that have fundamentally altered the relationship between humanity and its environment.

## Purpose

Inspired by the idea that objects tell stories, this project seeks to trace the material threads that connect human ingenuity to planetary change. Each entry in this archive explores a single object—or sometimes a process—that acted as a catalyst, setting in motion transformations in agriculture, industry, navigation, communication, and beyond.

By collecting and curating these stories, we aim to create a living resource for students, researchers, and the public—a modern digital humanities project that encourages scholarly contribution and peer review.

## What is a "Catalytic Object"?

A catalytic object is any artefact, tool, machine, or schematic that:

1. **Accelerated change** in how humans interact with the natural world.
2. **Scaled impact** from local to regional or global levels.
3. **Created feedback loops**—often unintended—that reshaped societies, economies, and ecosystems.

Examples include:

* **The Plow** – turned soil, settled civilizations, and altered landscapes.
* **The Steam Engine** – unlocked fossil fuels and powered the Industrial Revolution.
* **Synthetic Fertilizer (Haber‑Bosch Process)** – multiplied food production and rewired the global nitrogen cycle.
* **The Cotton Gin** – transformed agriculture, slavery, and the ecology of the American South.
* **The Astrolabe** – enabled precise navigation and connected continents, triggering unprecedented ecological exchange.

## How to Explore
