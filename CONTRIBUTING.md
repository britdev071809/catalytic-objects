# Contributing to the Chronological Catalyst Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collaborative digital archive. This document outlines the process for submitting new entries for "Catalytic Objects."

## Contribution Workflow

We use a **GitHub Issues and Pull Requests (PR)** workflow to ensure each entry is reviewed and discussed before being added to the archive.

1. **Choose an Object**
   * Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/britdev071809/catalytic-objects/issues) to see if the object you wish to document is already suggested. If not, feel free to open a new issue describing the object and why it qualifies as a "catalytic object."

2. **Claim an Issue**
   * Comment on an open issue to express your intent to work on it. This helps avoid duplicate efforts.

3. **Prepare Your Entry**
   * Fork the repository (or create a branch if you have write access).
   * Use the [object‑entry template](_templates/object-entry-template.md) as the starting point for your Markdown file.
   * Place your completed entry in the `entries/` directory with a descriptive filename (e.g., `cotton-gin.md`).

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
   * Open a PR from your branch to the `main` branch.
   * In the PR title, use the format **"Feat: Add [Object Name] Entry"**.
   * In the PR description, reference the issue you are addressing (e.g., `Closes #2`).
   * Ensure your entry follows the template structure and includes all required sections.

5. **Review Process**
   * A curator (or community reviewer) will examine your submission for historical accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
   * Review comments may request clarifications, suggest additional sources, or point out factual errors.
   * Please respond to comments and make the necessary edits directly in your branch.

6. **Merge and Archive**
   * Once the review is satisfied, the PR will be approved and merged using a squash‑merge commit.
   * The issue linked to the entry will be closed with a comment pointing to the merged PR.

## Entry Template Requirements

Every entry must be a Markdown file that includes the following sections:

### Object Name
The common name of the artefact, tool, machine, or process.

### Date/Circa
The approximate date(s) of origin, first use, or widespread adoption. Use BCE/CE notation where appropriate.

### Material/Medium
What the object is made of (e.g., wood, iron, ceramic, paper) or, for processes, the key materials involved.

### Historical Context
A concise narrative of the object's invention, development, and initial purpose. Explain why it emerged when it did and who used it.

### Environmental Impact
Describe how the object changed the relationship between humans and their environment. Consider:
* Direct ecological effects (e.g., deforestation, soil erosion, species introduction).
* Indirect consequences through changes in agriculture, industry, transportation, or settlement patterns.
* Long‑term feedback loops (e.g., climate change, resource depletion, biodiversity loss).

### Image/Sketch
Provide a link to a public‑domain or freely licensed image of the object (or a representative schematic). If you include an image file, place it in the `images/` directory and reference it with a relative path. Always credit the source.

### Sources & Further Reading
List the key references you consulted (books, articles, websites, museum collections). Use standard citation format.

### Contributor(s)
Your name (or GitHub username) and optional affiliation.

## Style Guidelines

* Write in clear, accessible prose suitable for a general audience.
* Avoid jargon; define technical terms when necessary.
* Keep entries between 500–1500 words.
* Use Markdown formatting for headings, lists, links, and emphasis.
* All claims should be supported by reliable sources.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Be respectful, constructive, and collaborative in all discussions and reviews.

## Questions?

If you have questions about the contribution process, template, or the suitability of an object, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/britdev071809/catalytic-objects/issues) and tag it with the `question` label.
